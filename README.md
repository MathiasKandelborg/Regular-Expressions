## Installation

* `yarn` - might take a few minutes
* `yarn start` - For the Parcel build
* `yarn storybook` - For the Storybook build
  * **Note that the typings dir have to exist before running `yarn storybook`, otherwise imports will be wrong**
* `tsc` - to compile the typings if they don't exist
