# Regular Expressions

Made for the purpose of validating strings and arrays with regular expressions in JS.

## Getting Started

> These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a must-have for this project

Some extentions for VS Code are needed to fully utilise the config files.

* Prettier
* Eslint
* Stylelint

Install them from the 'Extensions' tab or use the code quick open (`CTRL+P`) and run these commands:

```bash
ext install esbenp.prettier-vscode
ext install shinnn.stylelint
ext install dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
```

The above list will get updated and separated into a needed and a practical extensions lists. For now, my entire settings file - including styling - is in the .vscode folder and would give an idea on what extensions to install if anything doesn't seem right.

#### This project is developed in TypeScript, make sure your environment supports this.

### Installing

> A step by step series of examples that tell you have to do to get a development env running

This codebase is managed with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), npm can be used but is **not** tested.

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MathiasKandelborg/Regular-Expressions.git
```

With HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathiasKandelborg/Regular-Expressions.git
```

Go into the directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ./Regular-Expressions
yarn
```

You might have to re-compile the ts files to avoid errors:

```bash
tsc
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Run the development server, `localhost:1234` becomes available with HmR

```bash
yarn start
```

To run the [storybook](https://storybook.js.org) for the visual part of validation:

* **Note that the typings dir have to exist before running `yarn storybook`, otherwise the imports from the compiled output files will be wrong**

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Running the tests

There aren't any tests yet. I'm not sure if any ever will be made.

This is a project made for playing with TS and i don't see much reason in adding tests when the project is so small. If the project grows a bit more, some tests will be added along with some kind of CI to go with it.

### Coding style tests

These will be added with next release version, as package.json script commands.

## Deployment

Well, this package doesn't belong on a webser on its own, does it?😉

That being said, this part will be updated with instructions on running the storybook build command _and_ on how to publish this code as a npm module. If the project grows i might add gh-pages, Heroku or something like that.

## Built With

* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Programming language (superset of JS) + build tool
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - Dependency Management
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) - Used to create interactive 'stories' based on code.
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Development server and possible build tool
